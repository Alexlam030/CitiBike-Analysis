**Project Summary and Goals**

CitiBank has launched a public bicycle sharing system servicing New York city. It has a subscription based service, where users can pay either a monthly or yearly fee. Users can opt out of a subscription and also do a one time payment based on the length of their ride.

This project's goal is to see what trends the service's riders have in order to both turn non-subscribers into subscribers and improve the service for current subscribers. These riders include both subscribers and non-subscribers.
